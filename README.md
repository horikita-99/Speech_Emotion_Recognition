# Speech_Emotion_Recognition
This project implements a deep learning pipeline for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) using the CREMA-D dataset. The model combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for extracting spatial features from spectrograms and LSTMs for capturing temporal dependencies in speech, enabling robust classification of human emotions from audio signals.
